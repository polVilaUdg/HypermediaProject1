### Information Architecture

The information architecture of the website is structured to be intuitive, fluid and satisfactory. Key sections are distributed as follows:

- **Navigation**: Top `nav` bar links directly to `About me`, `Portfolio`, and `Contact me`, making the layout intuitive.
- **Content Structure**: Sections include `landingpage`, `aboutme`, `experience`, `portfolio`, and `contactme`, each with relevant headings and content, promoting a logical reading flow.
- **Visuals & Icons**: Profile image, project icons, and SVG figures enhance visual appeal and interactivity.
- **Accessibility**: Use of `alt` text and icons partially supports accessibility, external `style.css` allows for responsive design.

This structure supports a clean, easy-to-navigate CV site that showcases skills and experience effectively.
